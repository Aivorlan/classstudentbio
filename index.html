    <p>Hi, I'm Quin! I was born in Tennessee and I grew up in Ohio.  </p>
    <p>I'm 26 years old and embarking on a new journey in Full Stack Web Development.</p>
    <p>What excites me most about this journey is being able to have a career that I can be passionate about.</p>
    <p>I've had a few years of downtime and wasn't sure what I wanted to do and I'm thankful this career path presented itself.</p>
    <p>Growing up I was drawn to music and was introduced to the flute where I learned to read treble clef and improve my skill as a musician. You can also catch me singing and writing songs.</p> 
    <p>I enjoy being active and I'm a person that gets excited by just about anything. I'm a "glass half full" kind of a person. I enjoy interior design and am intrigued by the minimalist lifestyle.</p>
